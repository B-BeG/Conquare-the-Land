Conqer the land is a counting game played with one deck of fifty-two cards.
Players each create three armies trying to beat their rival army's value.

Each player is dealt a hand of five cards.
Next, three cards from the deck are placedfaceup in front of each side. These are soldiers in your three armies.
Each army fights the one that's facing it. That's how the game begins. Players then take turns playing cards
by putting them face-down behind one of their armies. An army's strength is the total value
of the cards in a row. The more cards in a row the more powerful the army becomes.
You can't tell the value of the facedown cards, of course so you have to guess your enemy's total power.

Once an army reaches three or more cards they're all flipped over except the one farthest back.
So you can add more cards to power up an army but you end up giving your enemy hints in the process.
Once you use all your cards to create three armies it's time for battle! All cards are flipped over.
On all three rows, the highest point total wins. The side that wins at least two showdowns wins the battle.

Each card scores its numerical value except aces. In a duel, they count as one but they can also cancel
out an opposing army's strongest face card. Use your aces right and you can totally turn the game around.
